# üèÜ Python Challenge: Build an Expense Tracker with Mocked API Integration

## üéØ Challenge

Create a basic Expense Tracker application in Python, using TDD principles to build and test each feature step-by-step. This application will allow users to manage expenses by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records, but instead of storing data in a file, expenses will be managed through a simulated external API. Use mocking to simulate API responses, isolating tests from real network calls.

## üìö Key Learnings

By completing this challenge, you will:
- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests first and implementing code to satisfy them.
- Gain experience using `unittest` or `pytest` along with mocking techniques.
- Learn how to mock API calls using `unittest.mock` to simulate responses and control test conditions.
- Work with JSON data to structure expense records, simulating a real-world API integration without actual network calls.

## üë§ User Story

As a user of the Expense Tracker application, I want to manage my expenses by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting them through a command-line interface so that I can keep track of my spending.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### Functionality:
1. **Add an Expense**: Users can add an expense with a description, amount, and date.
2. **View Expenses**: Users can view a list of expenses retrieved from the API.
3. **Update an Expense**: Users can update an existing expense‚Äôs details.
4. **Delete an Expense**: Users can remove an expense from the list.
5. **API Interaction**: All expense data should be managed through API calls, but the API should be simulated using mocks during testing.

### Data Handling:
- Represent each expense as a dictionary with fields for `description`, `amount`, and `date`.
- Use JSON format for data interchange with the mocked API.

### TDD and Mocking:
1. **Red-Green-Refactor (TDD)**:
   - Start by writing failing tests for each feature, then implement minimal code to pass each test, refactoring as needed.
2. **Mocking the API**:
   - Use `unittest.mock` to simulate API responses instead of making actual network calls.
   - Test interactions with the mocked API for functions like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting expenses.

## üîÑ Example Flow

1. **Step 1**: Write test cases for each feature (add, view, update, delete), using mocking to simulate API calls.
2. **Step 2**: Implement functions for each feature to satisfy the tests, using mocked responses.
3. **Step 3**: Set up API response structures as JSON data within test cases.
4. **Step 4**: Run and refactor the code, ensuring all tests pass with the mocked API.

## üóÇ Sample API Response Structure

Each expense entry could have this structure in API responses:

```json
{
    "description": "Lunch",
    "amount": 10.5,
    "date": "2023-11-01"
}
```

## üîÑ Mocking API Calls

1. **Mocking GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Requests**:
   - Use `unittest.mock.patch` to replace API calls in the code with mocked responses for testing.
2. **Example Mock Setup**:
   - Mock `requests.get`, `requests.post`, `requests.put`, and `requests.delete` to simulate responses without network activity.
   - Control response data directly in each test, simulating various conditions and ensuring isolation from external dependencies.

## üîÑ Example Mocking Test Flow

1. **Setup Mocked Data**:
   - Create sample expense data as JSON to use in tests.
   
2. **Mock API Calls**:
   - Use `patch("requests.get")` or similar to simulate API responses for viewing expenses.
   
3. **Implement and Verify**:
   - Write tests for each function to check if they make the correct API calls and handle the simulated responses appropriately.

This simplified challenge focuses on applying TDD principles and API mocking, keeping implementation straightforward and testing realistic without needing actual API calls.
